## Zigzag Game


## About
Zigzag Game is an endless runner I build with Unity for my thesis. Players steer a ball through a twisting, random path and avoid falls to score high. Procedural Content Generation (PCG) creates unique levels using crowd opinion data. The game logs player actions to CSV and uses machine learning in Python to analyze play styles and improve level design. I craft this to explore mobile game development and data-driven mechanics.


## Features
1. Guide a ball with left/right inputs (keyboard or touch) on a dynamic zigzag path.  
2. PCG generates levels based on crowd data for varied, fun challenges.  
3. Save gameplay data to CSV for ML analysis (skill classification, difficulty clustering).  
4. Unity delivers smooth 3D visuals, a start screen, and a game-over screen with restart.


## How to Play
1. Use left/right keys or touch to steer the ball along the path.  
2. Avoid falling off to increase your score.  
3. Hit restart on the game-over screen to play again.
